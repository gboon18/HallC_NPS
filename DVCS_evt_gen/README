Using Bogdan's magnetic fields.
Target Length : 10cm.

20180719
PhysicsList class has been changed from TestEm09's to B3's
StepMax class is no more used(not has been used before)

20180724
Using FTFP_BERT physics list

20180730
target size changed 15cm, 5mm target cover

20180801
target size changed once more, 15cm length, 5cm diameter, 125um target cover
Using physicslist from Hadr01.(hadron physics)

20180814
Reduce simulation time
1. WorldMater : Air->Vacuum
2. Kill track after detection.

Physical volumes always exist.
Except sweeping magnet.
Field ON  : sweeping magnet exist.
Field OFF : no sweeping magnet. 

20190419
NPS calorimeter reconstruction software
and DVCS event generator implemented.

20190626
DVCS generator generate scattered electron and photon
with an asymmetric distribution. For both electron and photon
ex) If the spectrometer angle is x,
    larger number of particles are distributed in x+ side than in x- side.

DVCS generator for JLab users

20200722
DVCS generator is generating events with acceptances 1.1 times larger than the actual calorimeter and HMS
Acceptance in the generator can be larger.

Need to re-check vertex smearing and RFunction.
RFunction is the one used for the HRS in Hall A.
