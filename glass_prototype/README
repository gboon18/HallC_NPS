Using Bogdan's magnetic fields.
Target Length : 10cm.

20180719
PhysicsList class has been changed from TestEm09's to B3's
StepMax class is no more used(not has been used before)

20180724
Using FTFP_BERT physics list

20180730
target size changed 15cm, 5mm target cover

20180801
target size changed once more, 15cm length, 5cm diameter, 125um target cover
Using physicslist from Hadr01.(hadron physics)

Reduce simulation time
1. WorldMater : Air->Vacuum
2. Kill track after detection.

Physical volumes always exist.
Except sweeping magnet.
Field ON  : sweeping magnet exist.
Field OFF : no sweeping magnet. 

20190227
Only Calorimeter exists.
This is to plot shower profile.
Every step in the simulation, deposited energy and position is recorded.

1116->1080
Each event(primary beam), tree for the energy resolution is saved.

Copied from git->jlab_HallC_NPS_Energy_Resolution_Simulation/
Check the effect of energy resolution with 2mm of iron plate.

*_05112019_1 is the originals

20191127
*_27112019_1 : HistoManager.cc & SteppingAction.cc 's originals
removed saving shower profile inside the crystals.(too much memories!!)

This is to see the energy resolution dependence of the glass scintillator
on the size of the material.
The glass scintillator is for the EIC EMcalorimeter.
It is to test the 3X3 prototype and to decide the size of the scintillator
before going in to the production for the prototype test.
Won't be any optical photon physics process.
Only the Edep will be recorded.
