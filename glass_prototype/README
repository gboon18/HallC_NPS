This is to see the energy resolution dependence of the glass scintillator
on the size of the material.
The glass scintillator is for the EIC EMcalorimeter.
It is to test the 3X3 prototype and to decide the size of the scintillator
before going in to the production for the prototype test.
Won't be any optical photon physics process.
Only the Edep will be recorded.
