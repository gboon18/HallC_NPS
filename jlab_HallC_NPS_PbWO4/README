How to run
Compile it in your build directory (e.g. /build)
In /build, you will have /macros/vis.mac
/macros/vis.mac visualize the simulation.
You can run a simulation with macro files such as /macros/mono_11GeV.mac(not the one in the build directory)(11GeV electron beam hitting the target with 1e7 events).

In "/build" directory after compilation,
"./AnaEx02" is the executable.
When you run ("./AnaEx02" for the visualization. "./AnaEx02 {macro name}" for the event generation),
it will ask several variables for the simulation;
-gap between the crystals (please set the value higher than 0. Otherwise, it will crash)
-distance of the calorimeter from the target
-center of the calorimeter angle from the beam-pipe
-magnetic field "ON" "OFF" option (set field strength to "1" when you turn the field ON)
-name of the output file (e.g. "test.root")
-random seeds number #1, #2, #3

The optical-photon(scintillation inside the crystals) generation is "ON", so the simulation is very slow.
If you want them to be "OFF" you have to manually comment-out the optical photon physics in "source/src/PhysicsLists.cc"
"#include "G4OpticalPhysics.hh"" and "fOptPhysicsList"
--I know it is cumbersome and I will update it to be easily turn "ON" and "OFF"-able if needed in the future like magnetic field.

Using Bogdan's magnetic fields.
Target Length : 10cm.

20180719
PhysicsList class has been changed from TestEm09's to B3's
StepMax class is no more used(not has been used before)

20180724
Using FTFP_BERT physics list

20180730
target size changed 15cm, 5mm target cover

20180801
target size changed once more, 15cm length, 5cm diameter, 125um target cover
Using physicslist from Hadr01.(hadron physics)

20180814
Reduce simulation time
1. WorldMater : Air->Vacuum
2. Kill track after detection.

Physical volumes always exist.
Except sweeping magnet.
Field ON  : sweeping magnet exist.
Field OFF : no sweeping magnet. 

20190121
Size of the calo changed
1116 --> 1080
