Reduce simulation time
1. WorldMater : Air->Vacuum
2. Kill track after detection.

Physical volumes always exist.
Except sweeping magnet.
Field ON  : sweeping magnet exist.
Field OFF : no sweeping magnet. 

20190227
Only Calorimeter exists.
This is to plot shower profile.
Every step in the simulation, deposited energy and position is recorded.
